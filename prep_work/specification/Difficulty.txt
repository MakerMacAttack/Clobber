Also pops up over the rest of the dimmed components.

Main section: Lets you select one of three difficult options. This selects which Computer AI you play against.

Easy: Random walk AI

Medium: I'll have to check our notes to see what's medium. I think Minimize opponent moves or max flex.

Hard: The Clobbit itself, which I will try to update since right now it's easier than medium.

To the side will be the option for 2 player.
